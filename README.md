# rtosDiagrams
Images showing Real Time Operating System (RTOS) concepts and functionality.  

All images and diagrams in this repository are licensed under CC-BY-4.0 - feel free to use/modify them however you like, but include attribution to Brian Amos.

Any file with a *.drawio extension was created with https://www.draw.io/ - so if you'd like to modify something, start by opening the *.drawio file with the website.  So far, I've attempted to include the draw.io source in the *.png files as well, which allows opening the *.png file in draw.io as well.  This functionality might come in handy if someone happens to run across one of the images and also uses draw.io - they'd get a pleasant surprise to find out that the image is directly editable.
