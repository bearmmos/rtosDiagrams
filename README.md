# rtosDiagrams
Images showing Real Time Operating System (RTOS) concepts and functionality.  

All images and diagrams in this repository are licensed under CC-BY-4.0 - feel free to use/modify them however you like, but please include attribution to Brian Amos.

All of the diagrams were created with https://www.draw.io/ - so if you'd like to modify something, try using draw.io to open the file.  I'm including the  draw.io source in the *.png files, which allows opening the *.png file in draw.io for modification, or directly including the same file and open as a standard image.  This functionality might come in handy if someone happens to run across one of the images and also uses draw.io - they'd get a pleasant surprise to find out that the image is directly editable - it also makes for an easier workflow since the *.png files can simply be exported from draw.io (then I only need to keep track of one version of the file, instead of figuring out whether the exported *png is up-to-date with the *.drawio).
